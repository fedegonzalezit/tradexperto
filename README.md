# Tradexperto

Hi! I'm Federico, an Electronic Engineer and an algorithmic trader. When I was attending a subject at the university I made a project which uses a genetic algorithm to find the best parameters for a trading strategy. In that moment I realized that I was developing a noval framework for creating, testing and optimizing trading strategies based on classical rules or machine learning models. I decided to continue working on it and I created Tradexperto.
